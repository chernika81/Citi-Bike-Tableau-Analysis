## Citi Bike Analysis

## Total Number of Trips

### The total number of trip for Jersey City in 2022 is 895,485. The highest number of trips accured in summer, and winter has the lowest number of trips. That can be explained by the weather condition differences between the two seasons. Also the possible reason could be the vacations and the absence of school that people are taking during the summer period. August has the highest number of rides, and January is the slowest month.
